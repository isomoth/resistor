# Resistor

Resistor is a simple Java class that calculates a resistor's resistance value, based on user input consisting of ring color codes. 
User input: 4 colors. 
Color codes: 0=black, 1=brown, 2=red, 3=orange, 4=yellow, 5=green, 6=blue, 7=purple, 8=grey, 9=white, 10=yellow, 11=silver, 12=none

## Installation

No installations required. Just open the Java class in your IDE of choice (examples: Netbeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ).

## Usage

The program will ask you to fill in the color of the resistor's rings. After you do (in the console), it will output the resistance in Ohm, as well as the range between minus and plus resistances. 

## Contributing

This was just a beginner's exercise in Java. No need for pull requests at the moment. 

## Acknowledgment

This resistor is based on the curriculum of the course "Programmering 1" by Folkuniversitetet (2021). Only used for educational purposes.
